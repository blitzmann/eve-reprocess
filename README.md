Found on an archive of old scripts. This is probably from 2010 or something, and looks like it was a super rough attempt to determine whether or not you would make money by buying / selling reprocessed goods. I don't exactly know what it does or why I made it, but I'm in the process of archiving all my old shitty code so that IO can look back at it in another 10 year and laugh

The only tweak that I did to make it work again was to switch the pricing source from eve-central to evemarketer and find the oldest data dump I could to import into MySQL.
